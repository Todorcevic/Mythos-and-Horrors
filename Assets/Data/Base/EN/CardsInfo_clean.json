The cave, a labyrinth of darkness and hidden secrets, echoes with the sound of their footsteps and the constant dripping of underground water.\n Suddenly, a strange and distant chant reaches their ears, emanating from some hidden corner of the cavern. The sound, hypnotic and disorienting, seems to evoke images of arcane rituals and ancient secrets. At the same time, a gentle but insistent tremor is felt beneath their feet, as if something, or someone, is digging or moving in the unexplored depths of the earth.",

The ground, once solid and secure beneath their feet, becomes unstable, transforming into an uneven and natural terrain. This metamorphosis defies all logical explanation and geological knowledge.\n Although they are clearly in an underground environment, the investigators strangely perceive fragments and relics of what appears to be a residential structure, scattered among the cave formations. Here and there, they recognize elements reminiscent of a house, such as pieces of furniture, fragments of wallpaper, or even parts of window frames, embedded in the cave walls as if they had been absorbed and fused with the geology of the place.",
