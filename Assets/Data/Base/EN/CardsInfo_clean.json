This metamorphosis defies all logical explanation and geological knowledge.\n Although they are clearly in an underground environment, the investigators strangely perceive fragments and relics of what appears to be a residential structure, scattered among the cave formations. Here and there, they recognize elements reminiscent of a house, such as pieces of furniture, fragments of wallpaper, or even parts of window frames, embedded in the cave walls as if they had been absorbed and fused with the geology of the place.",
